## Projects

### Twitter Sentiment Analysis Using Python
- Description: Developed a Twitter sentiment analysis model using Python. The model was able
to classify tweets with higher accuracy and the results were visualized using Matplotlib.
Accomplishments:
● Developed a sentiment analysis model with higher accuracy.
● Visualized the results of the model using Matplotlib.
● Demonstrated the use of Twitter sentiment analysis in a real-world application
- **Tools:** Python, Matplotlib, TextBlob, NLTK, Data Sets.

### CoV2-19 Analysis using Python
- Description: Measured the correlation between well-being and COVID-19 infection rates using
public data. Found a strong negative correlation between the two variables, meaning that as
COVID-19 infection rates increase, well-being decreases.
Accomplishments:
● COVID-19 infection rate and well-being are strongly negatively correlated: as
infection rates increase, well-being decreases.
● Findings suggest that the COVID-19 infection rate harms well-being. This is likely
due to several factors, such as social isolation, economic hardship, and fear of the
virus.
- **Tools:** Python, Data Sets.

### Hospital Website using React
